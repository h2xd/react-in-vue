# React in Vue

This a simple example on how to mount [React](https://react.dev/) components in a [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) context with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), while keeping most of the Vue features like [two-way data-binding (v-model)](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/v-model.html).

This is not the most ideal approach and suites just as PoC. Feel free to reach out to make the example better or just fork it. ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Development

Install the following dependencies to start the development of the project.

| Tool           | Description                                                | Link                                                                                            |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NVM            | Node.js version manager                                    | https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating                                           |

Then you can install the node.js version of the project by running

`nvm install`

After that you need to install the `node_modules` of the project by running the following command:

`npm install`

Then start the application by running

`npm run dev`

**That's it happy development** üéâ
